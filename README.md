intel-cordova-tizen
===================

that could become the source for the apache incubator-cordova-tizen that is until now  empty 


framework/

    - cordova icon, for tizen we are not quite sure about the size to use...now it is a 64*64 png
    - inedx html, a starter html file 
    - tizen.css, for notifications UI
    - sounds/ beep.wav ,, a file that should be used by notifications to play a "beep"

js/
 where to put generated files from the cordova jake

lib/
    cordova.js, generated by make file

tizen SDK Samples/

mobile-spec/

a tizen SDK eclipse project (to be imported using Eclipse import wizard)

taken from after 2.0.0 tag

the cordova Legacy App slightly adapte to tizen :
    notifications/index.html is loading the tizen.css file for notifications
    (waiting to generate this from the source code)
    
    config.xml that is granting all tizen related features as m√πmost of them are required by the Codova JavaScript lib
    
    there will be more sample soon :
    (actually tizen sample ported to phone gap when is makes sense, first should be contacts samples)
